Making junit tests Report

Model:
	DataSource:
		constructor: what do you expect if some of the inputs are null or empty string?
		RepoKind: add a equal method to compare
		setHistory: what will we expect if the input was null
		hasHistoryChanged: return true just after constructing the object?
		what do you expect if input for the "set..." method is null in stead of String
		for some get methods: they may be called before set value for them
		
		
	LocalStateResult:
		constructor: what do you expect if some of the inputs are null or empty string?
		and what do you expect if input name is not contained in actoins?
		
		getName, getLocalState: both methods return _name. do you need two methods to do same thing?
		getAction: if name.startsWith(ERROR) what do you want to return?
		
	Relationship:
		constructor: same as above
		and I'm not sure what "Constants.class.getResource" this part means in the constructor
		(I guess you are getting the path to an image, but I'm not sure why cannot you just use the path)
		
	
	RevisionHistory
		constructor: checked in HgLogParser class
		sub/superHistory: if both classes have same history, it would say both of them are super/sub history
		of each other.
		
		getCommitters: why don't you want to return set of strings representing committers?
		And the problem for this method is:
		when two RevisionHistorys have same committer name appear more than once in different changesets,
		but if the name shows up more in one RevisionHistory than the other RevisionHistory, this method
		will return the name. And no matter how much difference they have, it will return its name only once.
		

		
		
Server:
	HgLogParser:
		parseLog: I didn't know how did you use "current".
		You used changeset and parents representation in different forms
		You didn't include changesets with only one parent
		Some user names will be a little wired when you store them.
